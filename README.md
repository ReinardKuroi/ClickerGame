# Elevating Experience: The Game
## Summary
Press the button as fast as you can and get points for that. Multiplier increases up to a limit. Ultimately pointless. Achievements and stuff.
## Gameplay
Click on button, get points.
Points depent on multiplier and speed.
Multiplier increases with points.
No lose condition.
Fancy music and psychedelic artstyle.
## Meta
No particular goal, it's more of an experience rather than a game. Artstyle mix between vaporwave, steampunk and neon. All textures are photocollages. Music is CC-4 and fits pretty well. Sound effect recorded and edited at home.
