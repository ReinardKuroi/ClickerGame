Press the button as fast as you can until the door closes. Get points for it, the faster the better. Unlock new buttons to press and doors to close. Ultimately pointless.

Points depent on multiplier and speed.
Multiplier increases with points, time and levels (doors).
No lose condition. Can add timer (?)
